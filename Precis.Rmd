##DATA

```{r}
#I will be working with NBA data and looking into Gordan Haywards return to the Celtics and the kind of impact it may have on Wins, playoff/Championship chances ect. I am having trouble getting the CSV files, so I put in fake data top just have something. I should have the actual data soon from basketball-reference.com. 

haywardstats <- read_excel("GordanHaywardStats.xls")

ghperseason <- haywardstats %>% 
  head(n = 9) %>% write_rds(path = "shinygh")
```
