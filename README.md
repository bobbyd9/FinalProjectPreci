# GordanHaywardCounterfactual

Topic: I calculate what Gordan Hayward's statistics would have been if he did not got hurt in his first game as a Boston Celtic in the 2017-2018 Season. I preform this by using first a SPS prediciton formula to calculte his PER 36 min statsitics and then use equations from basketballreference.com to calcuate advanded NBA metrics.

Background Information:
Gordan Hayward is a NBA forward currently on the Boston Celtics. He was traded from the Utah Jazz and was coming off a All-Star Caliber Season. You can look more into his Basketball career at https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/haywago01.html.

Summary:
After doing the projections, we say that Gordan Hayward was posied to have a similar All-Star caliber season for the Celtics. He was predicted to average 20.1 points, 5.2 rebound and 4.0 assists. These numbers against other NBA players put him where he is expected to be as an elite NBA player. Interesting observations can be made when comparing his projections to his current season stats. It is obvious that he is not the scorer he was, as currently, he is averaging 15 points a game, however his rebounding numbers have gone up. Maybe this is due to him changing his role on the team or easing back into his scoring role. Another observation is that he would have been a clear boost to the Celtics as they made a championship push in 2017. Compared to the players that replaced him, his projected stats gave him a clear advantage in most categories and it is extremely evident in win shares (ws) and Value over Replacement Player (vorp). This leads me to believe the Celtics would have had a much higher chance at a title if Gordan Hayward would have been playing. On the other hand, a question to think about is how much has the Celtics benefited that Gordan's absence as allowed Jayson Tatum to get valuable experience and maturity he may have not gotten before.
